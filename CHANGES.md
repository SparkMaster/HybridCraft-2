Seb, Please read this from now on and edit it instead of the
commit......

For Example:

Started on the Food side of HybridCraft. C:
**Please watch out for ID's... Material and Food share
down the same id list...

IE:
cobblehoeID = 661
--
babID = 662
foodwbID = 663

Quoted out foodwb.. (Going to try and get that one fixed
soon.)
